- **Issue Editing**: Inline editing of issue fields and bulk operations
- **Issue Relationships**: Link issues, create sub-tasks, and manage dependencies

### 3. Agile Boards

- **Scrum Board**: Drag-and-drop kanban board for sprint management
- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of issues ready for sprint planning
- **Sprint Management**: Create, start, and complete sprints with burndown charts

### 4. User Management

- **Authentication**: Secure login/logout with session management
- **User Profiles**: User information, avatar, and preferences
- **Team Management**: Assign users to projects and manage permissions

### 5. Workflow & Status
